  "app_context": {
    "type": "Mobile App",
    "platform": "iOS (inferred from status bar with time on left, signal/battery on right)",
    "purpose": "Online learning platform for courses in design, development, and marketing",
    "target_audience": "Professionals or learners interested in skill-building, likely adults seeking affordable short courses based on pricing and content"
  },
  "overall_style": {
    "design_philosophy": "Minimalist and modern, emphasizing clean lines, ample white space, and a focus on content hierarchy to reduce cognitive load. It follows Material Design-inspired elements (rounded corners, card-based layout) but with a flatter, iOS-like aesthetic. The style prioritizes usability over ornamentation, aligning with skeuomorphic elements in instructor photos for relatability.",
    "visual_theme": "Light mode dominant with high contrast for readability. Neutral palette with subtle accents, evoking professionalism and approachability. The use of real-life instructor photos adds a human touch, contrasting with abstract digital designs.",
    "consistency": "High across screens: Consistent navigation, card styles, and typography ensure intuitive flow. Transitions between browse and detail views feel seamless, likely with smooth animations (inferred from rounded UI elements).",
    "responsiveness": "Optimized for mobile portrait mode; elements scale well for touch interactions, with generous tap targets on buttons and cards."
  },
  "color_scheme": {
    "primary_colors": {
      "background": "#FFFFFF (pure white) for main areas, promoting cleanliness and focus on content",
      "accent": "#000000 (black) for buttons and category tabs, providing strong contrast and call-to-action emphasis",
      "text": "#000000 (black) for headings and body, with #808080 (gray) for secondary info like session counts"
    },
    "secondary_colors": {
      "cards": "#F0F0F0 (light gray) for subtle shadows or borders, though minimal shadowing is used to keep it flat",
      "ratings": "#FFD700 (gold/yellow) for stars, standard for positive feedback",
      "hearts": "#FF0000 (red) implied for favorited items, but shown in gray outline here"
    },
    "usage_analysis": "Monochromatic base with pops of color in icons (e.g., play button in gray). This scheme enhances accessibility (WCAG AA compliant for contrast ratios, e.g., black on white >4.5:1). It avoids overwhelming users, suitable for educational apps where focus is key. Potential improvement: Add subtle brand color for uniqueness."
  },
  "typography": {
    "font_family": "Sans-serif (likely system fonts like San Francisco for iOS), clean and legible for digital screens",
    "hierarchy": {
      "headings": "Bold, 18-24pt for course titles (e.g., 'UI/UX Masterclass'), creating clear focal points",
      "subheadings": "Medium weight, 14-16pt for details like '14 Sessions - 5 Hours'",
      "body_text": "Regular, 12-14pt for descriptions, with line height ~1.5 for readability",
      "labels": "Small caps or bold for sections like 'Curriculum', 12pt"
    },
    "usage_analysis": "Consistent kerning and spacing prevent clutter. Text is left-aligned for natural reading flow. In curriculum, expandable items use chevrons for interactivity cues. Strengths: Scalable for accessibility (dynamic type support inferred). Weaknesses: Limited variation might make long descriptions monotonous; suggest italic for emphasis."

      "structure": "Top: User greeting and search bar (sticky header inferred). Middle: Horizontal category tabs (scrollable if more). Bottom: Vertical course list with cards. Navigation bar at bottom.",
      "element_placement": "Search bar prominent for discoverability. Cards use 16:9 aspect ratio images for visual appeal, with overlay avatars for personalization. Pricing right-aligned for quick scanning.",
      "balance": "Symmetrical with centered elements, but asymmetrical in card content for interest (image left, text right in details)."
    },
    "right_screen_detail_view": {
      "structure": "Top: Back button and favorite icon. Middle: Hero image, title, meta, description, curriculum accordion. Bottom: Fixed CTA button ('Enroll Now').",
      "element_placement": "Curriculum uses collapsible sections for progressive disclosure, reducing overwhelm. Description is concise, with 'Show More' for expansion.",
      "balance": "Vertical flow guides eye from visual (image) to info (text) to action (button), following F-pattern reading."
    },
    "navigation": {
      "global": "Bottom tab bar with icons and labels (Home, My Learning, Wishlist, Account), persistent for quick access.",
      "local": "Back arrow on detail screen, search in browse. No hamburger menu, keeping it simple.",

    "icons": "Outline style (e.g., heart, play), monochromatic. Consistent size ~24pt.",
    "images": "High-res instructor photos with neutral backgrounds, cropped to focus on subject. Adds trust and engagement.",
    "ratings": "Star system with decimal (4.8), count of reviews/enrollments for social proof.",

  "ux_flow_and_interaction": {
    "user_journey": "Entry: Login/welcome -> Browse/search -> Select course -> Detail view -> Enroll. Supports wishlist for deferred decisions.",
    "affordances": "Clear cues: Search placeholder invites action, arrows for navigation, buttons for CTAs. Gesture support: Swipe back, pull-to-refresh inferred.",
    "feedback": "Instant (e.g., loading states not shown, but assumed). Success on enroll would confirm payment.",
    "error_handling": "Not visible, but search should handle no results gracefully.",
    "accessibility": "High potential: Semantic markup for screen readers, color contrast. Alt text for images, voiceover support.",
