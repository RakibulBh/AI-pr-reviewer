Consist is a revolutionary goal-tracking app that transforms overwhelming aspirations into achievable daily actions through intelligent goal breakdown and AI-powered motivation. Unlike traditional habit trackers, Consist focuses on identity transformation by helping users become the person they want to be - whether that's a "morning person," "fitness enthusiast," or "productive professional." The app breaks large goals into manageable sub-tasks, provides real-time progress visualization, and features a unique "Motivate Me" button that delivers personalized encouragement based on your specific progress and motivational style. What sets Consist apart is its proactive struggle preparation system that alerts users when they're approaching common quit points (like "67% of people quit here") and provides targeted support to push through difficult moments. Users earn customizable rewards for completing milestones, see their progress through beautiful visualizations, and receive daily reminders designed to build discipline rather than just send notifications. The app combines behavioral psychology with cutting-edge AI to create a personal coach that understands your journey, celebrates your wins, prepares you for challenges, and consistently reinforces your evolving identity as someone who achieves their goals.
